# s3\_website setup

I've updated my website configuration in github. I updated [Dockerfile](https://github.com/xydinesh/s3.xydinesh.com/blob/master/Dockerfile) to include
debian based build. Now testing and deployment is easier. 

### Testing

```
make build
make run
```

and then open http://localhost:4000 to test new blog post. When ready to deploy,

### Deploy
```
make deploy
```
