# Acceptance

I have a problem with writing in my blog. I always want to write but I don't make the time to write in the blog. I have accepted that writing in the blog is not something I enjoy. It could be because of the expectations I have around expressing my ideas.

In general I enjoy writing, I use writing in different ways, I write to retain, I write to get clarity, and I write to get  alignment (at work). However, for some reason I can't get myself to write in my blog. Therefore, I accepted that I don't want to write in my blog. 

I was in denial last four years that thinking I will get back to writing in my blog. Looking at the posts in my blog I realized that I haven't written anything last 3+ years in my blog. That's over 1000 days. 

Talking about my blog, I tinker with diffent ways to publish my blog. A few months ago, I simplified my blog setup (again). However I have a problem getting myself to write. 

I'm not going to hold myself accountable for writing in my blog. I would rather spend time in something I enjoy doing. If I get around writing, that's great. Only time will tell.
