  <h1>Junior Wrestling</h1>
<p>Last Sunday was a rough day for both me and my son (Ahas). Ahas ended up loosing all wrestling matches in the tournament. I have clearly set both of our expectation not for the wins but for doing his 
best. I was disappointed because I felt like Ahas was not doing his best. After the tournament I asked him why didnâ€™t he gave his best. That made him so upset. He repeatedly told me that he gave his 
best. That night I had time to reflect. I came up with better ideas for dealing with his losses.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I should not be the judge of whether Ahas gave his best or not. I can question him to ask if he gave his best and should be ready accept his answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I should be appreciative of his effort to get out there and wrestle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We (Both me and Ahas) need to come up with <code>SMART</code> goals for him to achieve during tournaments.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>S - Specific<br/>
M - Measurable<br/>
A - Agreed Upon<br/>
R - Realistic<br/>
T - Time based<br/></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not let opponent pin him.</li>
<li>Try to score 3 points.</li>
<li>Try to stay 1 min before ending this game.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to give these ideas a try for coming tournament.</p>
